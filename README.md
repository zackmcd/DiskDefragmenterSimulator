# DiskDefragmenterSimulator
This was a project I had to design for a data structures and an algorithm analysis course. 
It is a disk defragmenter simulator that re-orgranizes the files on a simulated disk.
The program rearranges the disk blocks so that: 1) the first file starts on disk block #2, 2) all of the blocks of each
file are in sequence and contiguous, and 3) all unused blocks are located at the end of the disk.
